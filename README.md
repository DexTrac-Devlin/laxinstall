## Directions

**This is intended for use on systems with apt or yum package managers**

If you already have docker & docker-compose installed, I recommend you make use of https://github.com/thodges-gh/min-cl-docker-compose

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlintrace/laxinstall/add-yum/laxinstall.sh`

`chmod +x laxinstall.sh`

`sudo ./laxinstall.sh`
